/**************************************
** Land 2 Shrine Defence
***************************************
This challenge begins after the player has built both a pub and a shrine.
A scroll appears at the shrine. When clicked on, a very old man enters the village and is surprised to find a god there. ‘Ah!’ he exclaims and offers to make up a batch of Ambrosia for the player, ‘like in the old days’. He will prepare it within the confines of the ‘most holy shrine’. The only thing is, that the sweet smell of the Ambrosia will attract the ‘giant monkey’ that lives on the land, and said ‘monkey’ will happily drink his fill. The player simply needs to keep the ‘giant monkey’ away from the ‘most holy shrine’ for a long enough period of time, and the drink of the gods will be finished. As the challenge nears completion, the Norse creature will become more and more desperate to get at the Ambrosia. When presented to the player, the Ambrosia becomes the heal miracle.
If the player fails to keep the creature away, they will get a second try.
To keep the creature away the player can:
•	Build walls keeping the creature out.
•	Attack the creature with an army.
•	Attack the creature with the Greek creature.
•	Throw rocks at it.
•	Try and get the Greek creature to befriend it and get them to go ‘somewhere else’ together.
•	Try and placate the creature with food.
•	Scare the creature off with fire.
•	Steal the creatures toys and lure him away with them.
***************************************

**************************************/

/*
Wait until the player has both a shrine and a pub in his town
Wait a while
Make a scroll
If eaither the pub or the shrine are destroyed (or even badly damaged), the
scroll will disapear until they are better.
When clicked, the intro cutscene will play.
Then the pub will slowly emenate an aura of potion brewing.
The Norse creature will gain desire to go to the pub.
If the Norse creature makes it to the pub, or the pub is destroyed, a
scroll will appear above the pub (when it is fixed if broken).
Whether the player succeeds or fails they get a scroll above the pub.
This will tell them whats what.
Finally, when successfull, they get a blueprint
